    <p>This shows you all the swimming sessions that have at least some lanes, or a good chance of lanes.</p>
    <p>It doesn't show you play sessions, aqua-fitness or sessions where you'd have to share the pool with a school. Women-only sessions are marked with a â™€. If you're looking at today's timetables, it only shows you sessions with at least an hour left to go.<br>
    <p>'Limited lanes' are where around half of the pool will be lanes</p>
    <p>'May be lanes' are sessions where the pool says they'll put in a few lanes if it's not too busy, or you're sharing the pool with aqua-fitness.</p>
